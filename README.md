# Maze-Generator-and-Solver-Dijkstras-s-
This repository contains the work done for a school project. The program is a python script that creates a user defined maze with the use of the sidewinder algorithm, and solves it with Dijksta's algorithm. The user chooses the maze size, starting- and goal postions, the density of the maze, and the speed at wich the pathfinding is executed.
